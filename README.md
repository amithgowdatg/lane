A highly accurate and reliable real-time lane detection system for ADAS and autonomous vehicles achieves a 96.16% detection rate on the KITTI dataset under diverse conditions such as shadows, road discoloration, and faded markings. By combining advanced computer vision techniques, it effectively filters unwanted edges, isolates vertical lane lines, and delivers precise tracking with timely lane departure alerts. While performance may decrease in poor weather, low visibility, broken markings, or complex road layouts like intersections and sharp curves, the system remains robust, adaptable, and scalable, with strong potential for integration into real-world ADAS to enhance safety, reduce accident risks, and support autonomous navigation. With continuous advancements in AI and sensor fusion, its accuracy and reliability can be further improved. This system lays a strong foundation for next-generation intelligent driving solutions.
